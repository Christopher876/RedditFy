Daily Updated Spotify playlist for music subreddits.

# r/IndieHeads

This Python program generates a dail updated Spotify playlist.

You can follow the playlist [HERE](https://open.spotify.com/user/99kylel/playlist/75svY6VFRSQ1CCXZa6t9Bk?si=YngA_VoiRBKOMPNo4-Q20g).

This was done using a combination of the BeautifulSoup4 library, as well as Spotipy library.

# Whats Next?

I plan on replicating this for other music subreddits.

I am going to see how adding albums works. I may change it so only singles get added.
