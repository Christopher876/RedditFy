# Whats Next?

I plan on replicating this for other music subreddits.

I am going to see how adding albums works. I may change it so only singles get added.

By no means to I expect anything, however some people on Reddit asked me how to they could support me. If you really want to you can support me, you can [HERE](paypal.me/jkl1999). I am a college student so anything is amazing, but really nothing is expected.
